/// An implementation of a Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) with fixed depth.
///
/// Functionally, this structure acts as a **Key-Value store**:
/// - **Key**: The path from the root to the leaf.
/// - **Value**: The data hash stored at that specific leaf.
///
/// A Sparse Merkle Tree is a perfectly balanced binary tree where most leaves are empty (contain default values).
/// Instead of storing every node of the massive tree (which would be impossible for depths like 256),
/// this implementation stores only the non-empty branches.
///
/// # Optimization: Precalculated Hashes
///
/// To efficiently handle the "sparse" nature of the tree, we utilize a `precalculate_hashes` array.
/// This array stores the default hash values for empty subtrees at each height level.
/// - `precalculate_hashes[0]` is the hash of an empty leaf.
/// - `precalculate_hashes[1]` is the hash of a branch connecting two empty leaves.
/// - ...and so on.
///
/// This allows getting the hash of an empty branch at any level in **O(1)** time without recomputing it.
///
/// # Security & Attack Mitigation
///
/// This implementation explicitly guards against **Second Preimage Attacks** (specifically
/// Merkle Substitution or Length Extension attacks) using the following techniques:
///
/// 1. **Path Binding (Position Binding)**:
///    The `raw_path` (bit representation of the tree path) is mixed into the initial leaf hash via
///    `eng.input(&[get_path_bits(...)])`.
///    * *Why?* This binds the data to a specific location in the tree. It prevents an attacker from
///      taking a valid internal node hash (from a deeper level) and presenting it as a valid leaf
///      at a higher level. Even if the data matches, the path/position will differ, changing the hash.
///
/// 2. **Domain Separation**:
///    The function initializes with `Hash(LEAF_TAG)`, where `LEAF_TAG` is an internal constant.
///    * *Why?* This ensures that hashes generated for this SMT state cannot be confused with other
///      Bitcoin/Elements hashes (like `TapLeaf` or `TapBranch` hashes), preventing cross-context collisions.
///
